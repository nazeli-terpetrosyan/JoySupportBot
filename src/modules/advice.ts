Some advice:

‚Ä¢ Make a sleep schedule (on paper or digitally, where you can see it) üìù 
‚Ä¢ Avoid excessive physical activity during the day so you don‚Äôt get tired üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
‚Ä¢ Avoid looking at your device screen unnecessarily (constant exposure to radiation can cause insomnia)üì± 

<i>Even if your body has difficulty coming to rest, tell yourself to fall asleep. Do not allow your body to control your mind and make you stay awake late. üîÆ </i>
